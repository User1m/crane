## Synopsis

> A crane is a type of machine, generally equipped with a hoist rope, wire ropes or chains, and sheaves, that can be used both to lift and lower containers.

Similarly CraneML is a command line tool to, not only help you containerize your ML model, but also enables you to quickly lift and deploy it to the cloud with an endpoint.

## Code Example

```
> craneml create ...
> craneml build ...
> craneml run ...
> craneml deploy ...
```

## Motivation

Containerizing and Operationalizing ML models is hard. Once you've created the next cancer-predicting AI model, how do you expose it as a service that can be consumed by other applications for their benefit?

CraneML was created to help solve this issue.

With a simple CLT, you should be able to package up your model and deploy to the cloud as a service.
