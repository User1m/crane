## Synopsis

> A crane is a type of machine, generally equipped with a hoist rope, wire ropes or chains, and sheaves, that can be used both to lift and lower containers.

Similarly Crane is a command line tool to, not only help you containerize your ML model, but also enable you to quickly deploy it with an endpoint.

## Code Example

```
> crane create ...
> crane package ...
> crane deploy ...
```

## Motivation

Containerizing and Operationalizing ML models is hard. Once you've created the next cancer-predicting AI model, how do you expose it as a service that can be consumed by other applications for their benefit?

Crane was created to help solve this issue. 

With a simple CLT, you should be able to package up your model and deploy to the cloud as a service.

## Installation

npm install crane
